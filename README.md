### my site 💫

👨🏽‍💻 • welcome to my portfolio site! i spent a few days checking out examples, learning, and coding to make this project as clean, modern, and responsive as possible — without forgetting usability.  

📱 • the idea behind the site is to simulate a macOS-like experience, with a desktop and taskbar where you can open, minimize, maximize, and close different sections.  

☄️ • hope you enjoy exploring it! as you click around, you’ll get a better idea of my work and potential as a front-end developer.  

📃 • built with jquery, tilt.js, and swiper.
